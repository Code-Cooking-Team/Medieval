-   The camera is top-down with a slight tilt; Z axis represents vertical height.
-   Game engine logic, actors, blueprints, and renderers in `src/game`.
-   Configuration schemas and loader in `src/config` (see `src/config/config.ts` for default settings and schema).
-   Helpful game and rendering configuration options defined in `src/config/config.ts` (e.g., tickTime, cameraFov, renderer settings).
-   Rendering pipeline uses EffectComposer, BasicRenderer, and ActorRenderer lists.
-   Professions implement AI via finite state machines in `src/game/professions`.
-   UI components, hooks, and modules under `src/ui`.
